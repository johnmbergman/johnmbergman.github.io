I am a professional software engineer who specializes in building scalable web applications.

In 2016, I graduated from Florida State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Through my university studies, I built a web application for auditing behavioral safety data. After graduating, I went to work for Amazon where I built and maintained back-end web services to support the Amazon Flex mobile application. Now, I'm working on a platform within Amazon Prime Video that enables independent filmmakers to publish their content to the Prime Video catalog.
