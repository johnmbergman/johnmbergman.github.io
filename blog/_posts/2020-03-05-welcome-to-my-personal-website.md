Thanks for visiting my personal website. I've decided to set up a blog on my website to begin documenting ideas and things I've learned along the way. This also gives me an opportunity to improve my writing and give me a sandbox to document my thoughts.

Posts I make will likely be technical, although I may write for some of my other interests. Please bookmark the site if you want to stay updated.

I used open-source software called [Jekyll][jekyll-home] to pre-generate static pages from posts managed in source control. I've decided to keep my personal website open source to allow others to learn how I set it up and maintain the source. You can find the source to the web page on the [GitHub Page][johnmbergman-github-io].

Thanks again for visiting, check back soon for more updates!
